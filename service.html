                <p class="para">We work closely with our clients and ensure the best design and most cost-effective technologies are used to complete each project. We have adequate equipment specifically designed to work in and around existing structures. We can put piles practically anywhere which is a cost-effective alternative for clients who are interested in developing outside of the urban city.  
                    With the help of skilled and expert workers, we make sure to do everything safely and efficiently while piling. Since pilling creates noise for surrounding we take every precaution to minimize disruptions to nearby people and inhabitants.
                    We do bored piling using a hydraulic drilling apparatus, by creating a vertical hole drilled into the soil. We have a thorough understanding of bored pile construction and engineering, as well as soil and site conditions that a highly specialized operation demands.
                    By impact hammering, vibrating, or pushing it into the ground to a design depth, a driven precast pile is installed. Specifically, when we find the soil in an aggressive condition, we conduct this kind of piling though it is allowed to be performed in all kinds of construction work. Since this process is faster
                    in terms of installation, we conduct it frequently if required. The groundwater cannot affect while driven precast pile installation takes place.  
                </p>
                <p class="para">With the help of a team of experienced engineers and workers, who are experienced with driven precast pile installation, we offer the standard piling solution at your service.

                <p class="para">To provide people with a safe transportation and mobility experience roads must be long-lasting and secure for driving to avoid endangering users and the environment. While doing the construction of roads, it is mandatory to prevent repair expenses as much as possible. 
                    It is difficult to build and maintain sturdy and lasting roads since they are exposed to extreme circumstances. However, we the keep cautious about the quality of components in road products, particularly bitumen since it varies greatly. Mainly better quality of bitumen is responsible for the extreme strength of the road to be exposed by heavy vehicles.  
                    Our service of road construction shows the standard of road materials and how they react to the heavy loads and exposed deterioration. We have the knowledge and experience necessary to take care of such types of projects.
                    In terms of testing and evaluating the performance and durability of road materials and products, our expertise and proper experience save many mismanagements.

It is either our office or residence apartment, where we spend the majority of our time a day and as a development company, we understand your safety concerns. That is why we recommend steel structures for most of our projects when we find it necessary. Currently, steel construction comes at an affordable cost and getting popular for the durability of structural safety reasons. 
                    Steel structures offer a wide range of designs that are visibility attractive and luxurious. These kinds of structures come with solid comfort options that are vital for human inhabitance.                     
                </p>
                <p class="para">We prefer to use steel structures for projects like factories, warehouses, workshops, building and commercial showrooms, etc. Despite traditional construction structures, steel construction frameworks become the subject of changing conventional construction systems.
                    In structure, steel is light but has high bearing strength. It has good processing and welding performance that minimize the construction development period.

                <p class="para">With architectural design service, we give a construction project a valid layout with exact measurement and shapes that is almost close to reality. The layout is an integral part of the architecture that is essential for carrying out a construction development project. You can get a clear conceptual vision of your project prior to its development through our 3D animation on architecture concept design. 
                    We conceptualize plans to aid the construction development project referred to as the project Master Plan. It offers a road map for future development decisions. In advance, a master plan helps us to set priority on the involvement of key professionals and experts in the concerned project, set the budget and costing of the project. By taking the decision about key works and conducting those like feasibility study, strategic framework, resource planning and design output, etc.
                    In addition, we also provide plans for buildings, architectural working design, 3D prospective view and design animation, interior-exterior design, rooftop management and conceptual Plan, etc.

                <p class="para">We prepare the design of the structure and superstructure based on the following process. Initially, we collect general information and review the architectural design for building framing. We start with program formulation where we decide the building will be built, storied numbers, basement Floors, units on each floor, foundation soil, types of exposures, surrounding structures, floor to floor Height, use of rooftop and ground floor, etc. The following stage framing system is finalized based on the architectural design and there are different types such as load-bearing, beam, column, tubular, and bundle tube systems, etc. A primary foundation type gets selected after analyzing the soil test report. Mainly from two types of foundations - footing foundation and pile foundation, we decide which one is applicable based on the sub-soil bearing capacity. 
                    A very integral part of structural design is load calculation, where we calculate the bearing capacity of the building or structure. After conducting load calculation we conduct structural analysis that delivers data for the next stage which is structural design. Finally, the process ends with delivering the printed sheet of the design to clients.

                <p class="para">As a part of our construction and development work, we provide electrical design services to help plan the design of the structure. During designing plans, our team assists building designers in preparing integrated electrical systems.  While focusing on many components of construction, such as structural, layout, safety, and plumbing, we ensure a safe electrical layout design that is appropriate for the building design. ABS CO. assures the accuracy of electrical layout designs to avoid probable accidents and follow the safety guideline. 
                    We have completed several projects on tower construction for different renowned telecommunication companies, like Teletalk, Grameenphone, Robi Axiata, Nokia solution, etc.  
                    With a collaboration with an experienced team of electrical engineers who are knowledgeable and experienced, we ensure each of our projects is successful. Along with civil structure construction work we have successfully completed site acquisition, power connection and commissioning work.
